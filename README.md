# MediCompile

## Project Description

MediCompile is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the management and analysis of medical documents. The project involves extracting text data from diverse medical documents, translating them into English if necessary, parsing the data into an SQL database, and creating a portal for doctors to efficiently review and analyze patient information. The system also includes a natural language to SQL query converter, making it intuitive for doctors to perform searches in the database.


## The Problem MediCompile Solves

MediCompile addresses the challenges in managing and analyzing diverse medical documents. It expedites the review of patients' medical records by automatically extracting relevant information from images of documents, translating foreign languages into English, and storing data in an SQL database. This process, which would typically take 1 or 2 weeks manually, is accomplished within seconds.

The intuitive portal for doctors incorporates a natural language to SQL query converter, allowing even non-experts to efficiently filter patient information. The system also facilitates the summarization of patients' medical histories, issues notifications when necessary, and predicts potential diseases based on past records and symptoms.

We express our gratitude to the open-source community, contributors, and the developers who helped build the technologies we used. Your innovative technologies have reshaped the way we approach resume creation.



## Challenges We Ran Into

One significant challenge involved developing the backend API to meet project requirements. Determining the specific information to include in the API response, considering the substantial data volume in our database, was a complex task. We navigated the balance between providing comprehensive data for analysis and ensuring a manageable and efficient API response.

Collaborative brainstorming was crucial in identifying key insights required by doctors for informed decision-making. Simultaneously, we optimized the API's performance to deliver these insights swiftly. Despite challenges, our team's dedication and expertise enabled us to overcome obstacles and deliver a robust backend API, demonstrating perseverance, innovation, and collaborative problem-solving.
