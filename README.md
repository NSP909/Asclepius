# Asclepius

## Project Description

Asclepius is a project that involves extracting text data from various medical documents, translating them into English if necessary, parsing the data into a database for later use. It also includes the creation of a portal for doctors to check each patient's data from the database, summarize them, and display them. Additionally, doctors can write natural language queries, which the program will convert into SQL queries to perform searches in the database and return the results in a table format, allowing for more intuitive actions for doctors.
